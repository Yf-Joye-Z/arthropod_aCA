# arthropod_αCA

This repository contains the data and scripts required to reproduce the results in [Evolutionary history of Alpha Carbonic Anhydrase (αCA) gene family across the phylum Arthropoda](Insert%20link%20here)

Each folder contains data required to recreate the results in each section of the manuscript.

## Details

#### `Arthropod_Chordate_aCA/` 
- contains amino acid and nucleotide sequences for all arthropod and chordate αCA used in this study. 
- [XXX_aCA_aa.fasta] -- amino acid sequences
- [XXX_aCA_cds.fasta] -- nucleotide sequences

#### `Arthropod_phylogeny/` 
- contains documents required to recreate the arthropod phylogeny generated in this study
- [unedited_arthropod_aCA.fasta] -- unedited amino acid sequences of arthropod and poriferan αCA used for the phylogeny and alignment-free clustering method. For the alignment-free clustering method, please see [Yeung et al., 2023](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/24/1/bbac619/) and its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/esbgkannan/chumby).
- [unlabeled_arthropod_aCA_phylogeny.contree] -- arthropod αCA phylogeny that is not labeled
- [labeled_arthropod_aCA_phylogeny.tbi] -- arthropod αCA phylogeny that is labeled.



#### `dN-dS_Evolution_Rate` 
- contains 1) an edited aCA fasta file, 2) a subphyla & clade-specific phylogeny, 3) a JSON file with raw dN/dS value, and 4) an excel file with dN/dS value after data-filtering. In addition, it contains 4 python scripts. 

#### `selection_pressure_analysis/` 
- contains
